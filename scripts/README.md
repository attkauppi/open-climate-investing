# Scripts

These are mostly python scripts used for data analysis, both in the command line and by the UI component:

 * `setup_db.py` - Initialize the database and load basic data
 * `get_stocks.py` - Get stock historical data
 * `get_regressions.py` - Calculate regressions for stocks versus factors
 * `bmg_series.py` - Create your own BMG series of high versus low climate risk stock returns
 * `correlate.py` - Calculate correlation of your BMG series versus other factors and create orthognalized series
 * `bmg_anlayze.py` - Analyze your BMG series's effectiveness in number of climate risk stocks identified by sector


Each of them has a `--help` option which explains what the parameters are.
