# The Tao of Decarbonization

This is an implementation of the [Oxford Offsetting Principles](https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2020-09-29-oxford-launches-new-principles-credible-carbon-offsetting).  We're here to use it in specific cases, and everyone in this DAO will stand behind our work with our own money buying offsets for own emissions.

The first step is to analyze the companies' general climate performance.  Companies which are not doing enough to reduce emissions should cost more to offset.  This will make it naturally more preferable to buy from the better companies.

While sustainable fuels are coming, offsets will be the only way to reduce our travel emissions for at least another decade to mid 2030s.

Both reduction and removal carbon credits are equally preferable given the high levels of emissions and the need to reduce emissions now.  Favoring removals when there are plenty of legitimate reductions is not a good idea.  If we donâ€™t reduce first, we could never remove enough later.

For an offset to be valid, it must satisfy all these criteria at the time of the activity - not when the original project was certified: additionality, baseline, leakage, permanence, real.

Permanence means minimum of 50 years.

Offset must prove it is valid on all criteria or will not be considered valid.

Offset must not be issued or retired in another registry, or it is double counting and will be invalid.

Offset must be purchased for a specific project and retired in your name or in your account name at a broker.  If the latter, you must be able to prove that you're the account holder at the broker.

If invalidated after purchase, replacement offsets must be purchased.
