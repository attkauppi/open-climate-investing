# Open Climate Investing DAO

## TLDR
 
A DAO to govern an open source alternative to traditional ESG ratings services which are expensive and inaccurate for climate investing. 

## Why this DAO?

### ESG and Climate Risk

Analyzing companies' climate risk exposure and climate actions is complex -- see [the chapter on Analyzing Investments](../book/Analyzing-Investments.md).  Today, most of this analysis is performed by ESG vendors using proprietary data sets and models.  Only the largest institutional investors could afford detailed ESG analysis from these vendors, yet the results are often difficult to use for making investment decisions.  Furthermore, as the experience of the 2008 Credit Crisis shows, the vendors' incentives may be often aligned with those of the companies being rated rather than investors or the general public.  As a result, ESG metrics suffer from a lack of trust, and this in turn limits the incentives for companies to make climate disclosures.  

## Goals

A DAO for creating open source climate investing analysis, including learning materials such as [the book](../book/README.md), industry specific climate analytical models (for example, energy, freight, airlines), and up to date analyses of individual companies' climate risk exposure.  

- Provide open, inclusive approach to rating companies' climate risk exposure.  "With enough eyeballs all bugs are shallow."
- Free for everybody: investors, government agencies, NGO's, and private individuals.
- Empower people everywhere with the knowledge and tools to understand what companies are doing (or not doing) about climate change.
- Create the broadest coverage of climate analysis for companies, following the Wikipedia, TripAdvisor, and Yelp models. 

This DAO will only provide climate investing analysis.  It is not a general investment analysis DAO.  It does not make investments.  It does not cover areas of Environmental, Social, Governance (ESG) or Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) beyond climate.  It provides analysis of the climate risk exposure for investing in companies, which could be used as a gauge of the companies' climate actions.

## Business Model

In today's financial markets, both companies looking to raise capital ("issuers") and investors pay fees to third parties such as Standard & Poor's and Moody's to rate investments.  Third-party ratings of companies' financial condition help objectively define what investments are appropriate for different group of investors.  This in turn allows companies sell securities to investors based on such ratings.  

The DAO's work similarly has value because it provides an objective, third-party rating for investors about the climate risks in companies.  The DAO provides a way for investors and companies to pay for these ratings through the purchase of tokens, which are then allocated to the community as payment for its work.
