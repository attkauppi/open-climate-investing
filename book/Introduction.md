# Open Climate Investing

## Introduction

If climate change is the epic challenge of our time, then we're all showing up like a half dressed, sleepy eyed mob for the game.  

International agreements are
slow in the coming and non-binding.  National emissions regulations, where they exist, are limited in scope.  Local government initiatives are underfunded.
Financial reuglators are busily meeting and advising, but not requiring anything concrete.  Investors love to sell ESG, talk about engagement, but the markets
act like climate change is far off.  Businesses caught the sustainability marketing bug but are slow to commit to emissions targets.  Environmentalists are
increasingly shrill in their warnings but quiet on actionable plans.
Meanwhile the general public is just sleepwalking along.  Most people believe climate change is real and want something done.  But outside of recycling some
bottles or making some donations, most of us are just waiting for someone else to fix it while we're busy with the rest of our lives.

I'm not here to point the finger.  We all need to do more, myself first and foremost.  This book is my attempt to fix that before it's too late. 
It's for investors (in the Ben Graham and Warren Buffett sense) with a long-term focus who are looking to do something about climate change while improving their investment results.  It is not a book of investment advice and won't help you speculate on cryptocurrencies or day trade to riches.  Instead, it is for professional fund managers like I once was, pension fund sponsors, foundations, endowments, consultants, and the increasingly sophisticated individuals who are beneficiaries of institutional investment funds or who are investing for themselves.  When completed, it will cover a range of topics including:

  * Impact of climate change on investment results
  * Analyzing investments and portfolios for climate risk and opportunities
  * Finding and using climate data and disclosures
  * Legal and regulatory considerations, including ERISA Fiduciary responsibility rules
  * Using the latest technologies such as DeFI, blockchains, and open source software
  * Engaging with your plans, beneficiaries, and investees for climate

Before you go further, let's all first recognize that climate change is a very hard problem to solve.  Otherwise you wouldn't be reading this -- I certainly wouldn't be writing it.  Climate change is difficult because it is a complex global problem that happens in small increments over long time horizons.  Our institutions, from governments to banks to businesses, are not well suited to solve problems like these.  They are focused on short time horizons, from quarterly earnings results to multi-year election cycles.  They are sized at regional or national scales.  They are slow to innovate and saddled with technology better suited for implementing simple, mechanistic solutions that apply to larger entities.  As a result, nearly three decades after the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change was signed, we still lack the basic mechanisms to account for and monitor greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in our economies.
