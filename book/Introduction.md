## Open Climate Investing

### Introduction

If climate change is the epic challenge of our time, then we're all showing up like a half dressed, sleepy eyed mob for the game.  International agreements are
slow in the coming and non-binding.  National emissions regulations, where they exist, are limited in scope.  Local government initiatives are underfunded.
Financial reuglators are busily meeting and advising, but not requiring anything concrete.  Investors love to sell ESG, talk about engagement, but the markets
act like climate change is far off.  Businesses caught the sustainability marketing bug but are slow to commit to emissions targets.  Environmentalists are
increasingly shrill in their warnings but quiet on actionable plans.
Meanwhile the general public is just sleepwalking along.  Most people believe climate change is real and want something done.  But outside of recycling some
bottles or making some donations, most of us are just waiting for someone else to fix it while we're busy with the rest of our lives.

I'm not here to point the finger.  We all need to do more, myself first and foremost, if we're to stop climate change.  This book is about the special role 
those of us who are
investors, whether professional fund managers like I once was or someone who is seriously interested in investments and finance, could do about climate change.
It is not a book of investment advice and won't help you speculate on cryptocurrencies or day trade to riches.  Instaed, it'll cover a range of topics from strategic issues of climate investing to
data and disclosures to structuring portfolios, both to provide your investment returns from the worst of climate change and take concrete action to stopping it.
