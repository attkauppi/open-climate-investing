# Open Climate Investing

## Introduction

If climate change is the epic challenge of our time, then we're all showing up like a half dressed, sleepy eyed mob for the game.  

International agreements are
slow in the coming and non-binding.  National emissions regulations, where they exist, are limited in scope.  Local government initiatives are underfunded.
Financial reuglators are busily meeting and advising, but not requiring anything concrete.  Investors love to sell ESG, talk about engagement, but the markets
act like climate change is far off.  Businesses caught the sustainability marketing bug but are slow to commit to emissions targets.  Environmentalists are
increasingly shrill in their warnings but quiet on actionable plans.
Meanwhile the general public is just sleepwalking along.  Most people believe climate change is real and want something done.  But outside of recycling some
bottles or making some donations, most of us are just waiting for someone else to fix it while we're busy with the rest of our lives.

I'm not here to point the finger.  We all need to do more, myself first and foremost.  This book is my attempt to fix that before it's too late. 
It's for investors (in the Ben Graham and Warren Buffett sense) with a long-term focus who are looking to do something about climate change while improving their investment results.  It is not a book of investment advice and won't help you speculate on cryptocurrencies or day trade to riches.  Instead, it is for professional fund managers like I once was, pension fund sponsors, foundations, endowments, consultants, and the increasingly sophisticated individuals who are beneficiaries of institutional investment funds or who are investing for themselves.  When completed, it will cover a range of topics including:

  * Impact of climate change on investment results
  * Analyzing investments and portfolios for climate risk and opportunities
  * Finding and using climate data and disclosures
  * Legal and regulatory considerations, including ERISA Fiduciary responsibility rules
  * Using the latest technologies such as DeFI, blockchains, and open source software
  * Engaging with your plans, beneficiaries, and investees for climate

Before you go further, let's all first recognize that climate change is a very hard problem to solve.  Otherwise you wouldn't be reading this -- I certainly wouldn't be writing it.  Climate change is difficult because it is a complex global problem that happens in small increments over long time horizons.  Our institutions, from governments to banks to businesses, are not well suited to solve problems like these.  They are focused on short time horizons, from quarterly earnings results to multi-year election cycles.  They are sized at regional or national scales.  They are saddled with outdated technology that create disconnected silos of information and activity.  Most of all, they are so slow
to innovate.   As a result, nearly three decades after the 
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change was signed, most of the world still chugs along as it always did--on fossil fuels and inertia. 

But this is a problem that we must solve, and it is one that we investors have a special role to play.  We are the group with the longest time horizon: Pension funds and life insurers invest for up to 30 years, and
foundations and endowments are supposed to continue in perpetuity.  We are also the group that's professionally trained and tasked to analyze complex data and scenarios and make risk/reward decisions.  We have 
helped turn emerging utopian technologies into everyday realities with those decisions, and we can do it again. 

Or can we?

Let's take a look at some good objections to climate investing.

Please read [Tariq Fancy's Secret Diary of a Sustainable Investor](https://www.dropbox.com/s/bvskswxwkro41rh/The%20Secret%20Diary%20of%20a%20Sustainable%20Investor%20-%20Tariq%20Fancy.pdf?dl=0) if you have not already. 

It's very well written.  Having been a portfolio manager myself, I could completely picture the people and the dialogs.  In summary, his key points are:

 * Fund management companies are happy to sell ESG, or at least a simplified version of them.
 * But portfolio manageres day to day do not incorporate ESG into their decisions, unless they see how it could generate higher returns.
 * The ESG data itself is confusing and often conflicting.
 * As a result, ESG investing is in fact lulling the public into thinking that we don't need government regulations, when in fact that is exactly what we need.  

While everything he says is true, I also see another interpretation of it:

 * Yes, portfolio managers would not incorporate ESG into their investments unless it generates higher returns.  That is the life of a portfolio manager.  We are like professional athletes without contracts or the Hollywood starlet who is only as good as their last role.  We are judged against indices given to us by the pension funds, foundations, and investment guidelines of our mutual funds or hedge funds.  And we're all just one trade away from humility.
 * This means, though, that we need to talk to those same pension funds and foundations.  They're the ones who are supposed to invest long-term for their beneficiaries.  If they've already signed to one of many climate investment pledges, then they need to use climate-aligned investment indices so that the fund managers could act accordingly.
 * Similarly, when marketing ESG to mutual fund and hedge fund investors, we must sign them up for the long-term with climate-aligned indices as our benchmarks.  This may mean fewer investors initially, but the greatest investors like Warren Buffett all know that the key is cultivating relationships with long-term investors.
 * Yes, it's not clear how useful a lot that ESG data really is.  We have a few suggestions.  Stay tuned...
 * Books could be written (and probably have been) about the failure of government climate programs.  Yes, government action would help--if it's done right.  But we also need investors to direct businesses to do their part.

Another interesting objection which I heard yesterday: "Public markets are just trading existing assets and don't affect the real economy."  Sadly true for many of the people who spend their days shuffling paper.  Long term, though,
 public markets play an enormously important role.  As investors shift from one asset class to another, the relative valuations change.  Higher valued public companies fund more investments, buy more innovative startups, 
which in turn create the eye-popping unicorn
valuations and exits that pull in venture capitalists to invest in startups.  They also lead to higher management bonuses and options.  Lower valued public companies, in turn, attract mergers, buyouts, and vulture investors, 
who like to consolidate operations, cut costs, and trim management along the way.  As a result, management of
public corporations are highly sensitive to stock prices and will work hard to boost them.

A similar objection: "One fund shifting from some stocks to another make no difference at all in the world."  Also true, but true of anything climate related.  What is the impact of one flight not taken or one person changing their diet?
It is only when we all act together that we can stop climate change.  This is true for investors as well.

"You cannot stop climate change by funding the same capitalist system that caused climate change."  Indeed, you can fund a great variety of grass roots projects all over the world, from forestry to sustainable agriculture, 
through the [voluntary carbon offsets market](https://opentaps.org/2021/08/23/voluntary-carbon-offsets-market-in-2020/).  Take a look at these numbers, though:

 * Amount of financing for voluntary carbon offsets - about $1 billion per year
 * Amount of financing for renewable energy - $322 billion per year
 * Amount of financing for all energy infrastructure - $1.26 trillion per year

There is absolutely a place for funding the projects of the voluntary carbon offsets market (Most of them, probably, but that could be a book of its own...)  Given how quickly we need to affect real change, though, we cannot just
let the main economy, with its corporations and financial markets, be.

### How to Use this Book

Please do not think of this as a "book."  It is a how-to manual that you can talk back to.  Use it for your climate investing, and then share what worked, what didn't, and how to make it better.  Tell me about the bugs and mistakes
you find.  [Create an issue on github](https://github.com/opentaps/open-climate-investing/issues).  It will be continuously updated to reflect the latest of all its readers' experiences.  

Climate change is happening because we're all living and working in our own little silos.  The only way to fix is to work together.

Ultimately we will live in the world that we worked to create, so let's get started and work to make it better.
