# Open Climate Investing

## Introduction

If climate change is the epic challenge of our time, then we're all showing up like a half dressed, sleepy eyed mob for the game.  

International agreements are
slow in the coming and non-binding.  National emissions regulations, where they exist, are limited in scope.  Local government initiatives are underfunded.
Financial reuglators are busily meeting and advising, but not requiring anything concrete.  Investors love to sell ESG, talk about engagement, but the markets
act like climate change is far off.  Businesses caught the sustainability marketing bug but are slow to commit to emissions targets.  Environmentalists are
increasingly shrill in their warnings but quiet on actionable plans.
Meanwhile the general public is just sleepwalking along.  Most people believe climate change is real and want something done.  But outside of recycling some
bottles or making some donations, most of us are just waiting for someone else to fix it while we're busy with the rest of our lives.

I'm not here to point the finger.  We all need to do more, myself first and foremost.  This book is my attempt to fix that before it's too late. 
It's for investors (in the Ben Graham and Warren Buffett sense) with a long-term focus who are looking to do something about climate change while improving their investment results.  It is not a book of investment advice and won't help you speculate on cryptocurrencies or day trade to riches.  Instead, it is for professional fund managers like I once was, pension fund sponsors, foundations, endowments, consultants, and the increasingly sophisticated individuals who are beneficiaries of institutional investment funds or who are investing for themselves.  When completed, it will cover a range of topics including:

  * Impact of climate change on investment results
  * Analyzing investments and portfolios for climate risk and opportunities
  * Finding and using climate data and disclosures
  * Legal and regulatory considerations, including ERISA Fiduciary responsibility rules
  * Using the latest technologies such as DeFI, blockchains, and open source software
  * Engaging with your plans, beneficiaries, and investees for climate

Before you go further, let's all first recognize that climate change is a very hard problem to solve.  Otherwise you wouldn't be reading this -- I certainly wouldn't be writing it.  Climate change is difficult because it is a complex global problem that happens in small increments over long time horizons.  Our institutions, from governments to banks to businesses, are not well suited to solve problems like these.  They are focused on short time horizons, from quarterly earnings results to multi-year election cycles.  They are sized at regional or national scales.  They are saddled with outdated technology that create disconnected silos of information and activity.  Most of all, they are so slow
to innovate.   As a result, nearly three decades after the 
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change was signed, most of the world still chugs along as it always did--on fossil fuels and inertia. 

But this is a problem that we must solve, and it is one that we investors have a special role to play.  We are the group with the longest time horizon: Pension funds and life insurers invest for up to 30 years, and
foundations and endowments are supposed to continue in perpetuity.  We are also the group that's professionally trained and tasked to analyze complex data and scenarios and make risk/reward decisions.  We have 
helped turn emerging utopian technologies into everyday realities with those decisions, and we can do it again. 

## How to Use this Book

Please do not think of this as a "book."  It is a how-to manual that you can talk back to.  Use it for your climate investing, and then share what worked, what didn't, and how to make it better.  Tell me about the bugs and mistakes
you find.  It will be continuously updated to reflect the latest of all its readers' experiences.  

Climate change is happening because we're all living and working in our own little silos.  The only way to fix is to work together.

Ultimately we will live in the world that we worked to create, so let's get started and work to make it better.
