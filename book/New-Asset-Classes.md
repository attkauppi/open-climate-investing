# New Asset Classes

So, by now, you're probably thinking -- Why even bother?  It is so much work analyzing these big, old fashioned, Greenhouse Gas emitting companies or, even worse, getting them to cut their emissions.  How about we just invest in projects that reduce or remove those GHG's?  All the cool people are investing in those.

## Renewable Energy

No longer a climate bet but an energy bet.  More like project finance investing: counterpart risk, off taker agreements, net metering.  Shift to merchant power from long off taker agreements.  Key technological issue is storage. "I've lost more money on battery companies than anyone," - Bill Gates.  

## Carbon Credits and Offsets

These __may__ well turn out to be good investments, but they are not without risks of their own.  Here are a few to consider:

Basis risk: The lack of correlation between negative carbon assets and other assets.  For example, [our paper](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3967613) found no correlation between the European Union Allowances (EUA) futures for GHG emissions rights and the stock market.  

Technology risk: These projects have their own specific risks, depending on what they do:

- Solar: Could a warming planet cause more cloudy days, reducing the output from solar panels?
- Wind: Similarly, could climate change reduce the amount of wind for wind power?
- Mangrove forests: Are mangrove forests dying as a result of climate change?
- Forestry: As the planet warms, some scientists believe that terrestrial forests will release more carbon than they absorb as a result of fires and changes to savannah and grasslands.  This may already be happening in the Amazonia.
- Soil carbon: Could we actually be wrong about whether the soil really sequesters carbon, or how much or how permanent the sequestration is?

Market risk: During the pilot phase, there are philanthropic funders who will pay to help these new technologies get off the ground.  But to scale up for mass adoption, they will need to be economically viable.  When will they achieve economic viability?  Will they depend on government policies until they do so?  Renewable energy saw a lot of help from government policy until they became cost competitive.  Other carbon removal projects may permanently need carbon credits to pay for them.  If you rely on government policies such as compliance carbon credit schemes, remember that they are both complex and slow.  If you are planning to tap into the voluntary carbon credits markets, know that market is very, very small.

How will this change over time?  Renewable energy is so big and mainstream now, there is too much of it at peak hours (duck curve.)  Will incentives such as net metering still be around?  Will utilities change their tariff rates to time of use so that peak renewable generation is worth less?  

Obsolescence risk: This is the counterpart to market risk.  Certain types of carbon credits have fallen out of favor and lost value over time.  For example, renewable energy was a dominant part of the market, but the falling prices of renewables have made carbon credits unnecessary for supporting them.  As a result, existing carbon credits from projects issued years ago have fallen in value.  Are they any less valid now that new renewable energy projects are no longer eligible for carbon credits?  That's an interesting debate, but unlikely to help the holders of the credits.

Regulatory risk: Will compliance programs continue to accept your technology and project type?  Will net metering be repealed?  Will you be able to get permits for rolling out the projects?

Counterparty risk: If you are investing in projects to provide energy or generate carbon credits, who are you selling to, and what is the risk of their defaulting?

Liquidity risk: If these are long term projects, will you be able to sell them when you need money for something else?  If you are planning to finance them, how will your funding counterparty mark your positions for collateral?

Early days - Lots of different standards.  Eventually market will converge either to the government compliance standards or large private sector ones.  Will your project make it?

Compliance carbon credits: Understanding the government regulations.  For example: Europe's overallocation of credits.  China's emissions intensity standard.  Expanding to new sectors.  Push back against financial investors and speculators.

Voluntary carbon credits: Very heterogeneous market, over the counter, illiquid.  TSVCM recommends futures contract but look just at the Gold Standard marketplace, Ecosystems Marketplace survey -- there is such a big range a futures market won't cover much of it.  Also see the BCT -- exactly the cheapest offsets got tokenized.

Voluntary carbon offsets market prizes novelty, pays up for unusual project types.  Once technology hits mainstream questions about additionality plus supply pushes down the values.  There is a period between when the technology is mature and market ready and when offset standards start to rein back issuance -- Renewable energy: [2016 paper](https://ec.europa.eu/clima/system/files/2017-04/clean_dev_mechanism_en.pdf) pointed out most CDM projects were not additional.  In 2021 Verra and Gold Standard modified their renewable energy methodology to exclude projects which are not in the lowest income countries.  During this period lots of potential supply ("free money") will push down prices.

## Investment 

Some general recommendations:

- Find a public equivalent to what you're planning to invest in.  For example, Hannon Armstrong (HASI) is a public company that owns solar and other renewable energy assets.
- Get a liquidity premium of at least an additional 1% in return or 20% in valuation for a private investment versus a publicly traded alternative.  In real estate terms, that's a 5% cap rate for a private investment versus a 4% cap rate for a publicly traded one.  This is __fair value__.  If you can get more, it's even better.
- Diversify

Then for the details: Is this investment debt (promising fixed payments) or equity?  If it's debt, think about the usual:

- Offtaker counter party default risk
- Value of assets supporting the debt
- What is the recovery process in the event of default?
- Rollover risk: What is the term of the debt, and how easily could it be refinanced so you can be repaid?  In the extreme are cryptocurrency stablecoins which promise the liquidity of cash.  Is the asset liquid enough to fund all of it?  Usually the answer is no.

If it's equity, think about the usual:

- Projected revenues
- Probability they'll be realized
- Debt that's senior to you

It's possible you'll be right and make money.

It's also possible that you'll be wrong and lose money.

Most annoyingly, it's possible that you'll be right and lose money anyway.
