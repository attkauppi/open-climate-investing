## Creating Indices

_"Success can be established in advance but cannot be forced." - Sun Tzu_

Now we come to the climax
Sponsors choose the index and fund managers manage to them
Supermarket of fund types: growth, value, international, sector specific, even art, watches and crypto currencies  - enough variety to make Bergdorf blush
ESG is a fund type
But climate needs to be in all the fund types: climate growth, value, etc.
There are a lot of established indices and good new ones.  You can use those and use this as a guide
Checking up on the index: carbon risk factor for the existing indices, vs portfolios, attributions of results
Creating your own: Structure portfolio with minimum tracking errors and key metrics (sectors and ratios) while reducing carbon risk factor
Efficient carbon frontiers

#### Footnote

The quote at the beginning is sometimes translated to "Every battle is won before it is fought."  The original Chinese, "胜可知，而不可为", means that the conditions for success are known or can be established in advance.
You cannot force it to happen, though -- you just have to wait for it.
