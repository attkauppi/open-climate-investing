## Climate and Investing

_It ain't what you don't know that gets you into trouble. It's what you know for sure that just ain't so. â€“ Mark Twain._

Catastrophe.

That word is used a lot (more) with climate change now.

I'm not here to convince you that climate change is real, or what the consequences of it will be.  Instead, let me show you what the investment implications of some of the climate predictions are.  

Climate change will pose several different categories of risks for investments:

 * Physical risks - Hurricanes, fires, and droughts
 * Transition risks - Carbon taxes, shifts in demand
 * Liability risks - Liability from climate risks, such as [PG&E's bankruptcy](https://www.wsj.com/articles/pg-e-wildfires-and-the-first-climate-change-bankruptcy-11547820006)
 * Second order risks - Water, biodiversity, supply chain interruptions and breakdowns, carbon border taxes, falling property values, and more

While climate risk analysis is still an emerging field, there is research which hint at both the effects of climate change on investments and the approaches available for performing analyses.  Analyzing the effects of climate is a multi-step process which involves projecting several key variables into the future:

 * Trajectory of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions based on current trends
 * Effect of GHG emissions on changing the climate, both locally and globally
 * Physical effect of those climate changes, such as droughts or hurricanes   
 * Financial impact of those physical effects
 * Mitigation measures, such as the various policies to reduce emissions and "decarbonize"
 * Adaptation measures against the risks, including hardening infrastructure and reducing emissions

Each risk category will be affected differently: Physical risks depend on the effect of GHG levels on storms, while transition risks depend on the measures taken to limit the effects of climate change.  Thus, measures which reduce physical risk for some assets may increase transition risk for others.

### Physical Risks

Physical risks are calculated by mapping assets, such as buildings or plants, and then running models for hazards such as hurricanes, flooding, and fires on the assets.  The models would project physical damage, which would then need to be converted into financial losses to calculate the additional expected loss due to climate risks and identify portfolio vulnerabilities.  There are both commercial models such as ClimateWise and FourTwentySeven and open source models such as [CLIMADA](https://github.com/CLIMADA-project/climada_python) that could be used. 

The NGFS Case Studies book performed several such analyses:

 * In Chapter 6, an analysis of the impact of natural disasters on residential mortgages in China's coastal cities showed an increase in defaults by anywhere from 0.04% to 0.38% (from baseline of 0.4%) and losses by 0.01% to 0.11% (from baseline of 0.11%) under the RCP 6.0 scenario.  This wide variability results from differences in climate scenarios and variability in the effect under each of those scenarios (Mean, Severe, and Extreme) around those scenarios.  These numbers sound smaller than they actually are.  At the baseline 0.4% default rate and 0.3% loss severity, the cumulative losses for a 30-year mortgage pool assuming 8% constant prepayment rate is 1%.  If the default rate increases to 0.58%, the cumulative loss is 1.43%.  At 0.78% default rate, the cumulative loss is 1.9%.  Compared to [Fannie Mae's historical loss rates](https://capitalmarkets.fanniemae.com/media/20926/display), we see that the cumulative lifetime loss rate rose from 1% for 2004 originations to 2.4% for 2005.  So we're not quite at full blown credit crisis levels but getting there.

### Transition Risks

 * Chapter 7 of the NGFS Case Studies book analyzed the effect of transitioning to the Paris Agreement's 2-degrees scenario on coal-fired power generation companies in China.  The analysis projected the effects of higher carbon taxes (RMB 508/tCO2e, or about $78/tCO2e), lower demand (-30%), and lower price for power generated (RMB 0.20/KW instead of 0.33/KW) due to falling price of renewables on the income statement and balance sheets of the electric utilities.  It did not look good.  The combined effects of all these shifts would push the probability of default for these companies to over 20% by just 2030.  This would push the credit ratings to the single B category.

### Second Order Risks

 * Chapter 9 of the NGFS Case Studies book analyzed the effect of water shortages on different companies in the mining, power generation, and beverage industries by applying a "shadow water price" to the amount of water used.  The shadow water price is based on what the price of water _should_ be given its economic value.  It was calculated for different regions of the world based on availability and use of water, and then allocated to different companies based on the locations of their operations.  Surprisingly, it found a much greater impact on mining and power generation companies than beverage companies.  Because of the higher operating costs from higher water prices, the Net Debt/EBITDA increased by 2x to 3x for several of these companies, putting their debt into speculative grades.
