## Climate and Investing

_It ain't what you don't know that gets you into trouble. It's what you know for sure that just ain't so. â€“ Mark Twain._

Catastrophe.

That word is used a lot (more) with climate change now.

I'm not here to convince you that climate change is real, or what the consequences of it will be.  Instead, let me show you what the investment implications of some of the climate predictions are.  

Climate change will pose several different categories of risks for investments:

 * Physical risks - Hurricanes, fires, and droughts
 * Transition risks - Carbon taxes, shifts in demand
 * Liability risks - Liability from climate risks, such as [PG&E's bankruptcy](https://www.wsj.com/articles/pg-e-wildfires-and-the-first-climate-change-bankruptcy-11547820006)
 * Second order risks - Water, biodiversity, supply chain interruptions and breakdowns, carbon border taxes, and more

While climate risk analysis is still an emerging field, there is research which hint at both the effects of climate change on investments and the approaches available for performing analyses.  Analyzing the effects of climate is a multi-step process which involves projecting several key variables into the future:

 * Trajectory of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions based on current trends 
 * Mitigation measures, such as the various plans to reduce emissions and "decarbonize"
 * Adaptation measures against the risks, including hardening infrastructure and reducing emissions

Each risk category will be affected differently: Physical risks depend on the effect of GHG levels on storms, while transition risks depend on the measures taken to limit the effects of climate change.  Thus, measures which reduce physical risk for some assets may increase transition risk for others.

### Physical Risks

Physical risks are calculated by mapping assets, such as buildings or plants, and then running models for hazards such as hurricanes, flooding, and fires on the assets.  The models would project physical damage, which would then need to be
converted into financial losses to calculate the additional expected loss due to climate risks and identify portfolio vulnerabilities.  There are both commercial models such as ClimateWise and FourTwentySeven and open source models such as [CLIMADA](https://github.com/CLIMADA-project/climada_python) that could be used. 

The NGFS Case Studies book performed several such analyses:

 * In Chapter 6, an analysis of the impact of natural disasters on residential mortgages in China's coastal cities showed an increase in defaults by anywhere from 0.04% to 0.97% (from baseline of 0.4%) and losses by 0.01% to 0.28% (from baseline of 0.11%)  This wide variability results from differences in climate scenarios and variability in the effect under each of those scenarios (Mean, Severe, and Extreme) around those scenarios.
