## Setting Benchmarks

_"Every battle is won before it is fought." - Sun Tzu_

Sponsors choose the index and fund managers manage to them
Supermarket of fund types: growth, value, international, sector specific, even art, watches and crypto currencies  - enough variety to make Bergdorf blush
ESG is a fund type
But climate needs to be in all the fund types: climate growth, value, etc.
There are a lot of established indices and good new ones.  You can use those and use this as a guide
Checking up on the index: carbon risk factor for the existing indices, vs portfolios, attributions of results

Analyze the S&P 500 Paris Aligned index in detail - How much less carbon risk, and why?

Create example indices which have less carbon risk

Monitoring and rebalancing requirements

Replication errors and minimum securities required to hold


### Who is Right?

_"Never tell me the odds." - Han Solo_

Han (aka the portfolio manager) may feel he knows exactly what he's doing when he attacks an Imperial Star Destroyer head on (aka doing a trade), but Princess Leia (aka plan sponsor) is rightly to be concerned, especially when C-3PO (aka plan consultant) is there to remind her what the odds are.

That's the problem with these statistical models of the market.  They can't tell you what will happen, just the odds--based on some preconditions.  C-3PO may know the odds of surviving a direct attack on an Imperial Star Destroyer, but nobody tried it the way Han did it.

#### Footnote

Actually, the quote at the beginning is mistranslated.  The original Chinese, "胜可知，而不可为", means that the conditions for success are known in advance.  You don't know exactly how to make it happen, but it will.
