## Setting Benchmarks

_"Every battle is won before it is fought." - Sun Tzu_*

As a portfolio manager, I often felt like we were in the mud up front while our clients sat in castles miles away, obliviously sipping tea while giving us benchmarks that were out of touch with reality.  They would exclude out of favor assets that offered the best opportunities while piling into flavor of the month investments that offered few.  They wanted short-term results from investments that clearly required long-term time horizons. Finally, they would exclude perfectly safe investments while allowing highly risky ones on the basis of arbitrary ratings.  The last one, by the way, is exactly what caused the Credit Crisis and Great Recession of 2008 -- read [The Big Short](https://amzn.to/33TkSnl) by Michael Lewis.

Of course I was biased.  With a little time and experience being the client, I now see I was as rash as Hans Solo -- "Never tell me the odds."  But how could the client decide except by looking at the numbers?  Yet judging "by the numbers" alone could also lead to a short term, academic view of risk and return that would not only be bad for your long-term investment results but also have disastrous consequences for climate change and the economy as a whole.  

What we had was a failure to communicate.  Guidelines and benchmarks should be set in consultation with the portfolio manager, but the portfolio manager should also be humble enough to understand that the client has more at stake than the latest and greatest trade.

This chapter, then, is my attempt to bring the two sides together.  It's me the portfolio manager talking with me the investor, in the hope that we could integrate long-term thinking about climate change into the investment process.

The first thing we should all do is take a look at risk.  This chart shows the performance of the optimized zero carbon risk portfolio versus the Energy index from the previous chapter on [Structuring Portfolios](Structuring-Portfolios.md):

![Value of Zero Carbon Optimized Portfolio Minus Energy Index](images/Value-Optimized-Energy-Index.png)

At first blush--The good guys won!  Everything worked out.  The climate aligned portfolio also way outperformed.  But how does this look?

![Dark Valley of Zero Carbon Optimized Portfolio Minus Energy Index](images/Value-Optimized-Energy-Index-2012.png)

Starting in 2010, after two and a half years in mid-2012, the optimized zero carbon risk portfolio would have been down nearly -47% versus the Energy index.  This was the dark valley of clean tech, after Solyndra went bankrupt and venture capital funding for clean tech practically came to an end in 2011.  A Harvard Business School article put it succinctly in [Clean Tech VC: A Decade of Failure](https://digital.hbs.edu/platform-rctom/submission/clean-tech-vc-a-decade-of-failure/): _In 2016, after nearly a decade and over $25 billion invested by L.P.’s,[11] 90% of clean tech investments can be considered abject failures, and close to 100% can be considered poor investments._

Or how about now?  The optimized zero carbon risk portfolio has outperformed the Energy index by a whopping 260% over the past decade.  Renewable energy stocks trade at two to three times the Price/Book ratios of the oil majors:

The oil stocks are rallying again.  The press is calling it an [ESG bubble](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-28/trillion-dollar-esg-boom-rings-bubble-trouble-alarm-in-new-study), because some [academic research papers](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Papers.cfm?abstract_id=3929359) said that the outperformance is the result of favorable capital flows rather than fundamental.  

Do you stay the course?  

Warren Buffett famously said that "The true investor welcomes volatility."  But he has the rare luxury of time that most do not.  He invests with a faith in the long-term principles that is also backed up by a reputation and an investment vehicle that took decades to establish.  Most portfolio managers and their clients, the investment officers of pension fund, endowment, reinsurer, or private banks, would not be around to see the rebound after a 40% underperformance.  Even principals investing their own money usually have liquidity needs, as well as a partner who would (reasonably) question their sanity.  

Yet [Buffett and other great investors](http://mastersinvest.com/volatilityquotes) are right.  Great investments, like the transition to a low carbon economy, take time.  The path to get there could be rocky, but the long-term outcome is not in doubt.  Volatility is not risk but opportunity--if you could survive the journey.

So the first important consideration is how to get there.  In other words, how much volatility could you tolerate?  How much of an underperformance would cause you to lose the portfolio--by getting fired or being forced to liquidate?  Stop this from happening by sizing the risk properly, like we had discussed in the previous chapter on [Structuring Portfolios](Structuring-Portfolios.md).

Part of your decision will have to be based on actuarial analysis: How much contributions and withdrawals would be expected.  Make sure you will not be forced to sell to meet those obligations.  If you're making a leveraged bet on a long-term trend like climate change -- ___DON'T DO IT___.

A bigger part, though, is one of values.  Why are you making a climate-aligned investment?  Do you believe some companies will outperform during transition to a low carbon economy?  If so, what is the time horizon for this to happen?  Five years?  Ten?  Twenty?  Thirty years?  

Or do you believe that climate change is fundamentally harmful to the well being of your constituents, so that you cannot invest in companies that contribute to climate change?  In that case, then are broad market benchmarks such as the S&P 500 even relevant, since they contain companies that contribute to climate change?

Taken a step further, do your constituents agree with you?  Do they want you making this decision for them?  Do they agree with your analysis of which companies contribute to climate change, and which do not?

The more you are aligned with your constituents, the more they will be willing to ride through the cycles with you, and the greater volatility you will be able to bear on the road to your ultimate goals.

Assuming that you decide "Yes, this is fundamental to our investment policy," the next question is how to do it.  

Do you engage or divest?  

On the surface, it seems the answer is simple.  The recent campaign by Harvard students serve as a good example.  In their [open letter](https://divestharvard.medium.com/letter-to-harvard-corporation-on-its-2050-net-zero-pledge-a7260fd2e76), "...engagement with the fossil fuel industry is dangerous and irresponsible. These companies are bad-faith partners in an effort towards decarbonization: their business models are predicated on continued extraction and exploitation of the world’s most vulnerable communities. They are not substantially transitioning to clean energy systems, have a record of attacking climate researchers (including Harvard’s own), and continue to block meaningful climate policy solutions..." 

Yet nothing in climate change is ever simple.  An article by Daniel Yergin, "[Why the Energy Transition Will Be So Complicated](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2021/11/energy-shock-transition/620813/)", sums it up pretty well.  These companies are so embedded in our world that many parts of our lives could not go on without them.  Furthermore, major countries whose economies are entirely dependent on oil and natural gas exports could not function without them.      

As investors, there is one more problem with a pure divest strategy: Valuations.  Look again at the relative valuations of the oil companies versus renewables:

![Relative Value of Renewable and Oil Majors Stocks](images/Valuation_BMG_Table.png)

The market is already pricing in a hefty premium for the renewables companies.  Even in the course of a long transition to a low carbon world, if the oil companies just have a few "dead cat bounces," it would cause the kind of short-term underperformance discussed earlier.  And what if a few of them really did change their act and became viable in that low carbon world?  Removing them completely could be a costly, not to mention unnecessary, mistake.

The alternative may be more difficult still: Engage with the oil and gas companies.  In 2015, leading UK environmentalist Jonathon Porritt wrote "[It is 'impossible' for today’s big oil companies to adapt to climate change](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jan/15/it-is-impossible-todays-big-oil-companies-adapt-climate-change-jonathon-porritt)".  Yet we're still trying.  Last year, institutional investors of ExxonMobil banded together to elect new directors with a focus on climate change, despite intense management opposition.  Meanwhile, CEO'S of major oil companies have come together under the [Oil and Gas Climate Initiative](https://www.ogci.com) with the stated aims to "accelerate the industry response to climate change" and "explicitly support the Paris Agreement and its aims."
 
Just what this could do ore recently, the UN Partnership for Responsible Investing's [collaborative engagement between major oil companies and their institutional investors](https://www.unpri.org/climate-change/engaging-oil-and-gas-companies-on-climate-results-of-the-pri-collaborative-engagement/6826.article).

Assuming you make those decisions, now choose an index.


Benchmarks -- ESG models - Are they correct?  Have they been too watered down?  Evaluating ESG-based indices.  Do they make sense?


Engage vs Divest?
- Engage: Can you really move the company?
- Divest: risk of valuation and industry gap.  SSRN articles cited here.

- Engage at a Price
- If inaction, then lower valuations as more people divest
- Or maybe company cannot transition and will liquidate and return capital to shareholders
- Worst is to continue to invest in industry going away
