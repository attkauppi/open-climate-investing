## Setting Benchmarks

_"Every battle is won before it is fought." - Sun Tzu_*

As a portfolio manager, I often felt like we were in the mud up front while our clients sat in castles miles away, obliviously sipping tea while giving us benchmarks that were out of touch with reality.  They would exclude out of favor assets that offered the best opportunities while piling into flavor-of-the-month investments that offered few.  They wanted short-term results from investments that clearly required long-term time horizons. Finally, they would exclude perfectly safe investments while allowing highly risky ones on the basis of arbitrary ratings.  The last one, by the way, is exactly what caused the Credit Crisis and Great Recession of 2008 -- read [The Big Short](https://amzn.to/33TkSnl) by Michael Lewis.

Of course I was biased.  With a little time and experience being the client, I now see I was as rash as Hans Solo -- "Never tell me the odds."  But how could the client decide on anything except by looking at the odds?  

The reality was that it was a failure to communicate.  Guidelines and benchmarks should be set in consultation with the portfolio manager, but the portfolio manager should also be humble enough to understand that the client has more at stake than the latest and greatest trade.

This chapter, then, is my attempt to bring balance to the process, and to use what I've learned on both sides to do something about climate change.

The first thing we should all do is take a look at risk.  This chart shows the performance of the optimized zero carbon risk portfolio versus the Energy index from the previous chapter on [Structuring Portfolios](Structuring-Portfolios.md):

The good guys won!  Everything worked out so well in the end.  But how does this look?

Starting in 2010, after two and a half years in mid-2012, the optimized zero carbon risk portfolio would have been down nearly -47% versus the Energy index.  This was the dark valley of clean tech, after Solyndra went bankrupt and venture capital funding for clean tech practically came to an end in 2011.  Harvard Business School put it succinctly in [Clean Tech VC: A Decade of Failure](https://digital.hbs.edu/platform-rctom/submission/clean-tech-vc-a-decade-of-failure/): __In 2016, after nearly a decade and over $25 billion invested by L.P.’s,[11] 90% of clean tech investments can be considered abject failures, and close to 100% can be considered poor investments.__

Or how about now?  The optimized zero carbon risk portfolio has outperformed the Energy index by a whopping 260% over the past decade.  Renewable energy stocks trade at two to three times the Price/Book ratios of the oil majors:

The oil stocks are rallying again.  The press is calling it an [ESG bubble](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-28/trillion-dollar-esg-boom-rings-bubble-trouble-alarm-in-new-study), because some [academic research papers](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Papers.cfm?abstract_id=3929359) said that the outperformance is the result of favorable capital flows rather than fundamental.  

Do you stay the course?  

Warren Buffett famously said that "Time is the friend of the wonderful company, the enemy of the mediocre."  But he has the rare luxury of time that most portfolio managers do not.  We would not be around to see the rebound after a 40% underperformance.  We do not have the decades or even longer that the transition to a zero carbon economy would take.

Only our clients do.  They alone could make the most fundamental investment decision: Time horizon.

As the client--the ultimate investor or their fiduciary--part of your decision will have to be based on actuarial analysis: How much contributions and withdrawals would be expected.  A bigger part, though, is one of values.  Why are you making a climate-aligned investment?  Do you believe some companies will outperform during the energy or zero carbon transition?  If so, what is the time horizon for this to happen?  Five years?  Ten?  Twenty?  Thirty years?  

Or do you believe that climate change is fundamentally harmful to the well being of your constituents, so that you cannot invest in companies that contribute to climate change?  In that case, then are broad market benchmarks such as the S&P 500 even relevant, since they contain companies that contribute to climate change?

Taken a step further, do your constituents agree with you?  Do they want you making this decision for them?  Do they agree with your analysis of which companies contribute to climate change, and which do not?

Assuming that you decide "Yes, this is fundamental to our investment policy," the next question is how to do it.  

### Goals

What are the goals?

Is it to make a stand on your moral values or to maximize the returns on your portfolio?  What is "long term"?  If climate change is 30, 50, 100 year time horizon, do you need to outperform in 5 or 10 years?

Or is the benchmark irrelevant if it harms the ultimate well being of your constituents?  What are your duties as a fiduciary?

Assuming you make those decisions, now choose an index.


Benchmarks -- ESG models - Are they correct?  Have they been too watered down?  Evaluating ESG-based indices.  Do they make sense?


Engage vs Divest?
- Engage: Can you really move the company?
- Divest: risk of valuation and industry gap.  SSRN articles cited here.

- Engage at a Price
- If inaction, then lower valuations as more people divest
- Or maybe company cannot transition and will liquidate and return capital to shareholders
- Worst is to continue to invest in industry going away
