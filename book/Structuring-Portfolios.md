## Structuring Portfolios

_"I don't throw darts at a board. I bet on sure things." - Gordon Gekko_


More true stories.

Early in my career, a man came into office and said he was the heir to a hair care products fortune.  He was moving to Los Angeles and looking for an investment company to manage his money.  Would we be interested?

We weren't sure he was who he claimed to be.  (His hair didn't look good.)  But how much did we have to lose?  It was a great opportunity for the newbies (me) to sit in on an investment presentation by the firm's founders.

So there I sat in a conference room overlooking the Pacific ocean, listening to our founders talk about our investment management process and risk management.  The man nodded and smiled as we went on.  Then they all went to lunch, and I went back to work.

We never heard from the man again.  We called their family office.  He was not real.

Fast forward a few years.  I'm now a senior portfolio manager at a different firm in New York.  Another man (yes, they were both men) came recommended as the "shoo in" for the Governor of a major State.  He's meeting people in New York today.  It would be a _really_ good idea for us to meet him.

So another conference room, this time overlooking the rooftops of the Manhattan skyline.  Now I'm one of the featured attractions.  We talked about our investment process and risk controls.  The man nodded and smiled.

A couple of weeks later, we got a letter on fancy bond paper inside a velum envelope.  He found what we talked about fascinating!  Would we support him to bring integrity back to government?  

We did not.  

He didn't become Governor of his State either.

Moral of the stories?  

Most institutional investment presentations are about the same:  Our firm has been around for (a long time) and specialize in (what you're looking at right now.)  We have really smart people (just listen to them) which do in depth analysis.  Just take a look at these examples of the (amount of industry knowledge | detailed financial analysis | sophisticated analytical models | impenetrable math | data mining and AI) we do.  On top of that, we overlay a disciplined risk control (look at these complicated charts.)  This is why we deliver you (consistent | high) returns, and here is a (client list) to prove it.

Which is not to say that the presentations aren't true.  In fact, most investment managers do follow a process like this, even if some of it is a little "aspirational" at times.  The difference is how it's done versus how plan sponsors and consultants may think it should be done.  As a portfolio manager, I always felt that they were too academic in how they viewed investing.  They seemed to believe the academics, who believe that sophisticated factor models are the answer: "My 3/5/7/13 factor model can explain all the return differences in returns and understand what the managers are doing better than they themselves do!"

Outside of a few high quant shops, though, most investors just don't think of things in factor terms.  We don't show up to work thinking "I got to adjust my HML today because I see a big move for low book value stocks next month."

Instead, we show up to work like shopaholics heading to the mall.  Most investors, whether individuals or big institutions, show up every morning looking to hunt down the latest bargains (those are your value investors), the latest and greatest (growth/momentum investors), or the truly unique, one-of-a-kind Sneakerhead finds (special situations, distressed, arbitrage investors.)  We then tuck away our finds and reminisce about how we found each bargain in our collection.  We can tell you exactly how it felt on the day we bought our favorite stock/bond/derivative years after the deed.  Even the ones who trade in esoteric derivatives using full blown models are like that.  They just know their investments by serial numbers instead of company names, and think of them in terms of weird metrics instead of real people.

Fortunately, there is (usually) some adult supervision involved, in the form of a Chief Investment Officer (CIO) or investment committee, or both.  They'll look over the portfolio and gather the key metrics, usually an overall risk measure (duration for bonds, market beta for stocks) and a sector breakdown.  Again, I don't see the kinds of risk factors espoused by academics and used by plan consultants and sponsors used, I suspect for the simple reasons that A) those models cost serious money and B) portfolio managers don't think in those terms, so they'll probably ignore them anyway.  

These metrics are compared to the index that the portfolio is benchmarked against.  The adult supervision is there to make sure that the differences are reasonable, ie the portfolio manager is not taking too much risk.  Here is where we could have some fun.

Some managers are extremely conservative.  They want no measurable difference versus the index.  All the return differences should only come from superior security selection.  But in markets with hundreds or even thousands of competitors, this is like trying to turn lead into gold.  Unless you can find something nobody else knew.  

Others believe they can tactically trade against their benchmarks, based on their market knowledge.  For example, overweight some sectors or go long the market from time to time, within constraints.  Again, not easy, simply because sector differences can be very volatile in the short term, even if the long term direction is well known.

Still a few brave ones (Bill Gross from PIMCO being one such hero) will proclaim that they believe the market will systematically go in one direction over the long term and therefore always maintain a calculated bias against their benchmark.  It will result in greater short term volatility, and some clients will not take it, but over time, if they're right, these long-term views will really boost returns.

The great thing with climate investing is that given how little it is understood right now, you could probably do well with all three.
