## Structuring Portfolios

_"I don't throw darts at a board. I bet on sure things." - Gordon Gekko_


More true stories.

Early in my career, a man came into office and said he was the heir to a hair care products fortune.  He was moving to Los Angeles and looking for an investment company to manage his money.  Would we be interested?

We weren't sure he was who he claimed to be.  (His hair didn't look so good.)  But how much do we have to lose?  It was a great opportunity for a newbie like me to sit in on an investment presentation by the firm's founders.

So there I sat in a conference room overlooking the Pacific ocean, listening to our founders talk about our investment management process and risk management.  The man nodded and smiled as we went on.  Then they all went to lunch, and I went back to work.

We never heard from the man again.  We called their family office.  He was not real.

Fast forward a few years.  I'm now a senior portfolio manager at a different firm in New York city.  Another man (yes, they were both men) came recommended as the "shoo in" for the Governor of a major State.  He's meeting people in New York today.  It would be a _really_ good idea for us to meet him.

So another conference room, this time overlooking the rooftops of the Manhattan skyline.  Now I'm one of the featured attractions.  We talked about our investment process and risk controls.  The man nodded and smiled.

A couple of weeks later, we got a letter.  It was a nice velum envelope with fancy bond paper.  He found what we talked about fascinating!  Would we support him on his mission to bring integrity back to government?  

We did not.  

He didn't become Governor of his State either.

The moral of story?  

Most institutional investment presentations are about the same.  Our firm has been around for (a number of years) and specialize in (what you're looking at right now.)  We have a highly qualified team (look at their resumes) which does in depth, fundamental research.  Just take a look at these examples of the (amount of industry knowledge | detailed financial analysis | sophisticated analytical models | data mining and AI) we do.  On top of that, we overlay a disciplined risk control (look at these complicated charts.)  This is why we deliver you (consistent | high) returns, and here is a (client list) to prove it.

Which is not to say that the presentations aren't true.  Even if some of it is, say, "aspirational" -- the models run on spreadsheets that minions (AKA analysts) manually maintain -- most serious investment managers do follow a process like this: In depth research plus risk controls.
