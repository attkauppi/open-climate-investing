### Planet Crypto

There's been a disturbance in climate finance.  The long obscure world of carbon offsets has collided with the red hot crypto universe.  The new technorati are turning to offsets as no less than a way to overturn the existing economy and financial markets and usher in a new world order of "regenerative finance" to heal (or, as they prefer, "unf*ck") the planet.  Their manifesto could be summed up as the following:

- The existing economy, with its government and financial markets, will not be able to stop climate change.
- To stop climate change, we need real financial incentives.
- To create those financial incentives, let's start a cryptocurrency backed by carbon offsets.  This varies from buying existing carbon offsets to commitments to buy carbon offsets from carbon direct removal projects.
- Let's use all the tools of Decentralized Finance (DeFI) to draw in speculators, who'll ape (_v: deploy large sums of capital with minimal diligence_ - See [Keep Kool Klima DAO Deep Dive](https://keepcool.co/klimadao-deepdive/)) and pump up the value of the cryptocurrency.

Perhaps the best example of this today is the combination of the [BCT](https://docs.toucan.earth/protocol/introduction/defi-refi) and [KLIMA](https://www.klimadao.finance/) tokens.  The BCT "bridges" the carbon offsets and the blockchain by retiring one tonne of offsets in the Verra voluntary carbon offsets registry and then creating a fungible ERC20 token on the Polygon Ethereum Layer 2 network representing one tonne of carbon.  KLIMA then created a new cryptocurrency based on BCT and used staking rewards, where holders of the KLIMA can deposit them in the treasury to earn additional KLIMA tokens, to draw in buyers.  With a discord channel of over 40,000 members, the KLIMA token traded as high as an $3,777.30.  

To true believers, this must be exactly the [Promise of Web3](https://mirror.xyz/0x26163318B9972E41A734602Fe00A5683D233613f):

_...to be totally opposed to web3 necessitates a strong belief that the incumbent system is good enough, with USD as the global reserve currency, the Federal Reserve printing money at will, and Big Tech owning your data and original content. It’s not hard to speculate that most people who think they’re opposed to web3, are actually believers who just don’t know it yet._

_One of the great things about crypto is how it democratizes access to investments._

_In order to gain access to early stage startup investment deals in tech, you've traditionally been required to be accredited and connected in Silicon Valley. In theory, the only true barrier to entry in crypto should be awareness._

_When you envision a future where any human can easily invest any amount of any asset into anything or anyone at any time, the future of traditional investing begins to appear bleak indeed._

_Founders have many new ways to fundraise with less friction. This means more focus on ideation and execution of the business, with less schmoozing, building decks, and painstaking interaction with legacy financial systems._

_Web3 will lead to unprecedented value creation because it provides exponentially better methods for the appraisal and management of digital property._

Meanwhile, those of us in the old fashioned world of carbon offsets might notice a few interesting things:

- Most of the carbon offsets used to back BCT and KLIMA are renewable energy offsets such as hydropower in China and Brazil (Source: [Toucan Monitoring Dashboard](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1i1RM51WzPjccXnwgMjabwYHpRtQt39Ju?usp=sharing#scrollTo=aWYy5jxkRZlC)) 
- These offsets were trading with an average price of $1.1 as recently as September 2021.  (Source: [Ecosystems Marketplace](https://www.ecosystemmarketplace.com/articles/press-release-voluntary-carbon-markets-rocket-in-2021-on-track-to-break-1b-for-first-time/))
- When the offsets are "retired" from the Verra registry, it means that they are used to offset the emissions footprint of the retiring party (retiree?)  They should have no value and never be traded again.  Toucan Protocol, creators of the BCT token, acknowledges that it is a [one way bridge](https://docs.toucan.earth/protocol/bridge/carbon-bridge).
- In other words, BCT tokens and anything based on it could only be considered assets by those who believe.  They could never be converted back to offsets and traded in the existing markets.

You might look at all this and shake your head, "We've seen this all before."  Or, as [Tim O'Reilly writes](https://www.oreilly.com/radar/why-its-too-early-to-get-excited-about-web3/):

_Repeat after me: neither venture capital investment nor easy access to risky, highly inflated assets predicts lasting success and impact for a particular company or technology._  

_Cryptocurrencies may well be the future of finance, but at the moment it’s hard to see what’s really working, given how much smoke is being blown._

_The failure to think through and build interfaces to existing legal and commercial mechanisms is in stark contrast to previous generations of the web, which quickly became a digital shadow of everything in the physical world—people, objects, locations, businesses—with interconnections that made it easy to create economically valuable new services in the existing economy. The easy money to be made speculating on crypto assets seems to have distracted developers and investors from the hard work of building useful real-world services._

But if you think this is just a rerun of the dotcom boom, with discord channels replacing AOL chat rooms and cyrptocurrencies replacing AOL, CSCO, and BCOM, you might've missed an important detail.  The dotcom boom of the late 90's was about technologies.  People speculated on stocks which represented ownership interests in the companies and the technologies they developed.  Today's cryptocurrencies are not so much about the technology -- blockchains, smart contracts, and consensus mechanisms -- as they are about financial engineering and leverage.  In that way, it is more similar to the junk bond/LBO boom of the 1980's and the conglomerate boom of the 1960's.  If you read about letter stocks, zero coupon convertible bonds, and pay-in-kind bonds, you'd find eerie similarities to today's crypto tokenomics.

So where do we go from here?  It's easy to dismiss it as the worst excess of crypto speculation ($1.1 to $3,777.30 should set a record for "alchemy of finance" somewhere.)  

And what if this is the wave of the future?  New DAO's are forming up daily on Discord to fund carbon offsets, carbon removals, regenerative agriculture.  How will they meet the needs of speculators and short-term traders while working on a very long-term problem like climate change?  Their interests are not naturally aligned.  For example, to stop climate change, we need to ramp up the amount of carbon offsets/reductions/removals, but the value of any currency, crypto or otherwise, increases when there is less supply of it.  Furthermore, offset prices must be high enough to encourage projects to develop but low enough to be acceptable to buyers as something other than an arbitrary tax.  Already in the European Union's Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), [Poland, Spain, and Czechia are protesting](https://www.euractiv.com/section/emissions-trading-scheme/news/europes-energy-price-hike-fuelled-by-speculators-spain-and-poland-say/) that financial players are driving up the cost of electricity and must be barred from the market.  [Poland and Czechia have even called for suspension of the ETS.](https://www.euractiv.com/section/politics/short_news/czech-minister-would-support-polands-call-for-suspension-of-eu-ets/)  

What will happen when the Revolutionaries of today are victorious and become the Oligarchs of tomorrow?  Will we have the kind of COP26 horse trading between climate cryptocurrencies and their DAO's?

Meanwhile the world continues to move forward.  Web3 is a new set of technologies.  Its effects are right now less obvious because it does not itself do something differently, but rather organizes the doing differently, in some ways radically so.  If it could be linked to real world activities as Tim O'Reilly suggests, then it could unlock tremendous potentials for climate action.  Let's look at a few examples.

### Supply Chain Emissions

### Ratings

Quiz: Which of the following companies has the highest market capitalization?

- Colgate-Palmolive
- eBay
- FedEx
- General Motors
- IBM
- Lockheed
- Marriott
- Moderna
- Standard & Poors

Answer: Standard & Poors.

If you've ever worked in the industry or read [The Big Short](https://amzn.to/3yt2bSs) by Michael Lewis, you'd be excused for thinking that S&P and Moody's were the poor relations of Wall Street.  But you're wrong.  They are the Matrix of high finance.  They are everywhere.  They are all around you.  If money makes the world go around, then information makes money go around.

ESG/climate information is not very good today.

Blockchain
- MRV - more data
- Reputation capital - more inclusive rating scheme
